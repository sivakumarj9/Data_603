# A Comparison of NoSQL Database Management Systems and Models
The article "A Comparison of NoSQL Database Management Systems" highlights the advantages of NoSQL databases over traditional DBMS:
###	NoSQL Database Models:
+ Document Store: Stores data in a document format with unique identifiers for easy retrieval. Examples: MongoDB, Apache CouchDB.
* Key-Value Store: Data is stored as key-value pairs in an array format. Examples: Redis, Memcached.
- Columnar Database: Stores data in columns for analytical and read-heavy workloads. Examples: Cassandra, Apache HBase.
+ Graph Databases: Represent data as graphs with nodes, properties, and edges for relationship modeling. Examples: OrientDB, Neo4j.

These databases prioritize high availability and consistency, meeting the demands of modern systems.

# Data Lakehouse
The Data Lakehouse is an innovative data management architecture that merges the flexibility of data lakes with the structure and reliability of ACID transactions found in data warehouses.
-	The key advantages include simplicity, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness.
+	It incorporates an engine designed for high-performance SQL queries on data lakes.
*	It replaces the Common Two-Tier Data Architecture, reducing data duplication and costs.
-	Data scientists and ML engineers frequently utilize popular tools such as Pandas and TensorFlow to easily access data from Data Lakehouse, making it a preferred choice among experts.
+	It handles structured and unstructured data for comprehensive analysis.
